## Personal notes on this project:
  My second React project and my first using an third party API. The whole process was really pleasant and i feel that i'm already quite comfortable working with React. The whole project took only a few days but i still managed to learn some new things while improving on previous knowledges. Since i'm  felling confident with the basic of React i will start working on more complex concepts and new techologies from the React enviroment (probably Next and Tailwind/Bootstrap)

React is still fun to learn and even though I enjoyed this project, I missed working on the backend as well.
